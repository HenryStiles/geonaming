# Geonaming: 3-Word Naming for Every Location on Earth

Associate a unique 3-word name with every location on the surface of the earth.  Inspired by the concept of [what3words.com](https://what3words.com/), this program uses a comprehensive word table and permutations to convert coordinates to 3 words and back.

## How it Works

1. **Word Source:** The program uses words sourced from the ispell word list, which is distributed under the GPL license.
2. **Permutations:** By leveraging permutations of the word list, the program can create unique combinations that represent specific geographic coordinates.
3. **Precision and Conversion:** The program has configurable precision for coordinates and can convert between the 3-word name and its corresponding coordinates.
4.  **Problems** The grid is based on the the length of a degree of longitude and latitude at the equator.  Longitude should be adjusted lower as you move away from the equator and word selection is completely random.
